Better late then never. The Xbox app for Jellyfin now has a new maintainer and its first release in 5 years.

The Jellyfin app on Xbox has been unmaintained for quite a while. 
While it was on lifesupport for the last couple of years, we were occasionally fixing bugs.

With the last release now 5 years old, and the continued interest in Jellyfin being available on Xbox overall, I decided to take over at least the superficial duties of keeping it operational and releasing when there are new features or bug fixes.

# Xbox 0.9.0 release

This new release has now been approved and is available as a new version on the Microsoft store for up-to-date Xbox consoles.

It contains a number of bug fixes, but the main change is the switch of the web browser engine the Xbox app is using, to a newer and more feature rich Chromium-based browser implementation instead of the old, legacy Edge one. 
This allows us to expand support to formats such as HEVC/4K and HDR on supported devices, in future releases after further testing.

# What to expect

I will be actively managing pull requests and try my best with bug reports, though we are still very reliant on your help with new features and bugfixes. 
If there are enough features and bug fixes done and merged, you can expect more releases in the future, though I will not give a definitive timeline for that.
