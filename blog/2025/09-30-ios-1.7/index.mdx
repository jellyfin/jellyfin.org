Download support is (finally) coming to Jellyfin for iOS!

{/* truncate */}

Jellyfin for iOS version 1.7.0 delivers the long-awaited downloads feature. This update introduces global download support complete with
Files app integration and sharing capabilities. Alongside this major new feature, the release brings additional technical improvements and
expanded localization support. A complete list of changes, including their respective pull requests, can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-expo/releases/tag/v1.7.0.8).

### Download support is here!

Direct downloads of all media types are now supported, working similarly to the Jellyfin web client and Android app. The download option
will be presented in the standard UI for users with appropriate server permissions. When selected, an entry will appear in the new
Downloads tab.

From the Downloads tab, users can:

- Open downloaded media in the Files app
- Share directly to other apps (like VLC) for viewing/playing
- Delete downloaded content

    style={{ maxHeight: '600px' }}
  />
</center>

Additionally, downloaded media can be browsed directly from within the Files app by locating the Jellyfin directory under Downloads.

#### Transcoded downloads

Transcoded downloads have transitioned from an experimental to an alpha setting, allowing for broader community testing of this emerging
capability. This feature enables transcoding of audio and video that cannot be played directly by the iOS media engine. The Jellyfin server
will convert these files to a compatible format, also enabling playback of compatible videos directly within the app.

**Important notes for users:** Server-side support for transcoded downloads is currently very basic. You may encounter various issues, and
the feature should be approached with this in mind. Currently, there are no options to control download quality, and in some cases,
transcoded files may be significantly larger than the original source files. Please report any issues you encounter on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ios/issues).

### Technical improvements

This release features several technical enhancements:

- **State Management Upgrade**: State management within the app has been migrated to [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) from
  mobx, resolving a major blocker for upgrading to the latest Expo and React Native versions.
- **TypeScript Migration**: Continued migration to TypeScript improves overall code quality and maintainability.
- **App Naming Consistency**: Updates made to the app name to ensure
  [consistent branding](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-meta/discussions/100).
- **Expanded Localization**: Added support for Afrikaans and Basque languages, thanks to our community translators.
- **Code Optimization**: Removed unused resources from the app.

### Supported iOS versions

**This release of the Jellyfin app will be the last major update to support iOS 12.** The next major release is planned to include an
updated version of React Native, which will require us to increase the minimum supported iOS version to at least 15.1. Users with devices
running older iOS versions will still be able to use the Jellyfin web interface, though future app updates will not be available for these
devices.
