All of the changes, accumulated over nearly the last two years, are too many to easily list, so we'll break them down in the sections below and hope all of you find something enjoyable.

The major highlighted changes are:

* numerous improvements to Hardware Acceleration (HWA), including:

  * Dolby Vision Profile 5 and 7 tone-mapping

  * CUDA-based tone-mapping for NVIDIA

  * extended OpenCL tone-mapping for Intel

  * hardware based subtitle burn in

  * Intel tone-mapping support for Windows

  * full OpenCL filtering for AMF on Windows

  * deprecation of OMX for raspberry pi, use V4L2 instead

* proper network interface binding and handling of proxied requests

* various fixes for DLNA, Sync-Play and m3u HTTP streams

* DLNA disabled by default

* extended NFO metadata import

* external audio and subtitle support including container (mks, mka)

* extended plain folder parsing

* enhanced detection and handling of DVD/BD ISOs and folders

* extend TMDb metadata provider (series state, season names, tags, logos, etc)

## Server

Some major fixes include a number of HWA improvements, explicit network interface binding, DLNA improvements, better NFO parsing, configuration cleanup (relics of the migrations in 10.7.z), and numerous metadata improvements, as well as the migration to .NET 6 which provides a nice stable language base for future improvements.

A point-form list of the changes compiled by the team is:

* General:

* Networking:

  * fix explicit IP/interface binding

  * disable UPnP by default (only applies to new setups)

  * proper handling of published server URLs

  * disable DLNA server by default to avoid security risks

* HWA:

  * implement hardware-based subtitle burn-in (significantly faster)

  * implement proper tone-mapping support on Windows

  * add CUDA & OpenCL tone-mapping support for Dolby Vision profile 5 and 8

  * various fmp4 fixes

* NFO:

  * add parsing of additional ids

  * proper importing of watched state
