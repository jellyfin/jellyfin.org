## Significant changes

In this post I will focus on a few of the popular and significant changes. As always, a lot more changes were made both visible and
invisible; check out the full changelog to discover the full extent of this release.

### Music playback

Playing media is the key feature of Jellyfin. Up until now the Android TV app had many issues playing every possible format. The code
was also hard to work with making it challenging to fix the issues or implement new features. To counter this we decided to rewrite all
playback code completely from scratch. In this release the initial results are ready for daily use and playing music will use the new
playback code!

While a lot of this work is not directly noticable when using the app, some of it is. Crashes should now be uncommon, starting music is
faster and the remote control now responds more reliably. We've also added media sessions, this allows you to play/pause from other
applications on your TV or even your smartphone!

Improved codec detection should reduce transcoding and use direct play more often resulting in faster playback with less strain on the
Jellyfin server. We already have plans to improve this even more and add preferences to fine-tune this for your specific devices. Other
planned features include showing lyrics, enabling SyncPlay and gapless playback support.

Work has already started to rework video playback based on this new code so we can add all kinds of new features with ease in a shared
code base for both video and audio playback.

### Screensaver

The screensaver has received some nice additions. It was redesigned to be faster, with better animations and a much nicer appearance.
Alongside this redesign, new functionality was added. Music playback has been added to the screensaver, replacing the old screensaver from
the 'now playing' screen. Additionally, the screensaver is now enabled by default when the app is open, eliminating the need to enable it
system-wide.

And the best part: the screensaver now works when the video player is paused!

### Search

The search screen was partially rewritten to improve performance. It will now cancel any pending search requests while typing and use
a different method for getting the results. With these changes, a search on a large server is now noticeably faster and no flickering
occurs anymore.
