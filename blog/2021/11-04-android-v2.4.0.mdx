Compared to the last major release, Jellyfin Android 2.4.0 isn't as feature packed, but it still includes some useful changes and various fixes. Read on to learn more!

{/* truncate */}

The biggest improvement right of the start is support for additional audio codecs in the integrated video player, allowing even more media to direct play on your device. Specifically, that includes Dolby Digital, Digital Plus and TrueHD, as well as DTS and Linear PCM audio, all commonly found on DVDs and Blu-rays, but also a more universal AAC support.

Additionally, The integrated player now follows the rewind/fast forward preferences selected in the Jellyfin settings.

Apart from that, connection reliability was again improved, handling timeouts properly now and showing a progress indicator while the app connects (thus it won't be stuck on black screen anymore).
