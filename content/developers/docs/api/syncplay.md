# Jellyfin SyncPlay API Documentation

SyncPlay allows multiple users to synchronize their media playback in real-time. This document outlines the WebSocket
messages and provides links to the REST API documentation for SyncPlay functionality.

## Overview

SyncPlay uses a combination of REST API endpoints for control actions and WebSocket messages for real-time
synchronization.

## REST API Endpoints

For detailed information about all SyncPlay REST API endpoints, including request/response schemas and examples, see
the [official Jellyfin API documentation](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay).

### Quick Reference Links

**Group Management:**

- [Create Group](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayCreateGroup) - `POST /SyncPlay/New`  
  Creates a new SyncPlay group with a custom name. Use this when you want to start a new synchronized viewing session
  and invite others to join.

- [Join Group](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayJoinGroup) - `POST /SyncPlay/Join`  
  Joins an existing SyncPlay group by ID. Use this to participate in someone else's synchronized viewing session.

- [Leave Group](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayLeaveGroup) - `POST /SyncPlay/Leave`  
  Leaves your current SyncPlay group. Call this when you want to stop participating in the synchronized session.

- [List Groups](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayGetGroups) - `GET /SyncPlay/List`  
  Gets all available SyncPlay groups you can join. Use this to browse active groups before joining one.

- [Get Group](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayGetGroup) - `GET /SyncPlay/{id}`  
  Gets basic information about a specific group (name, state, participants).

**Playlist Management:**

- [Set New Queue](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySetNewQueue) - `POST /SyncPlay/SetNewQueue`  
  Replaces the entire group playlist with new media items. Use this to start watching something completely different or
  create a new viewing queue.

- [Set Playlist Item](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySetPlaylistItem) - `POST /SyncPlay/SetPlaylistItem`  
  Jumps to a specific item in the current playlist. Use this to skip to a particular episode or movie in the queue.

- [Remove From Playlist](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayRemoveFromPlaylist) - `POST /SyncPlay/RemoveFromPlaylist`  
  Removes specific items from the playlist or clears the entire queue. Use this to remove unwanted content or start
  fresh.

- [Move Playlist Item](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayMovePlaylistItem) - `POST /SyncPlay/MovePlaylistItem`  
  Reorders items in the playlist by moving an item to a new position. Use this to reorganize the viewing order.

- [Queue Items](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayQueue) - `POST /SyncPlay/Queue`  
  Adds new items to the existing playlist (append or insert next). Use this to add more content without replacing what's
  already queued.

**Playback Control:**

- [Unpause](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayUnpause) - `POST /SyncPlay/Unpause`  
  Resumes playback for all group members simultaneously.

- [Pause](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayPause) - `POST /SyncPlay/Pause`  
  Pauses playback for all group members simultaneously.

- [Stop](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayStop) - `POST /SyncPlay/Stop`  
  Stops playback for all group members.

- [Seek](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySeek) - `POST /SyncPlay/Seek`  
  Jumps to a specific time position for all group members. Use this to skip intros, or jump to specific moments.

- [Next Item](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayNextItem) - `POST /SyncPlay/NextItem`  
  Skips to the next item in the playlist for all group members. Use this to move to the next episode or movie.

- [Previous Item](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayPreviousItem) - `POST /SyncPlay/PreviousItem`  
  Goes back to the previous item in the playlist for all group members. Use this to rewatch the previous episode or
  movie.

**Playback Settings:**

- [Set Repeat Mode](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySetRepeatMode) - `POST /SyncPlay/SetRepeatMode`  
  Changes how the playlist repeats (None, RepeatOne, RepeatAll). Use this to control what happens when the playlist
  ends.

- [Set Shuffle Mode](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySetShuffleMode) - `POST /SyncPlay/SetShuffleMode`  
  Toggles shuffle mode for the playlist (Sorted, Shuffled). Use this to randomize the viewing order or return to
  sequential playback.

**Session Management:**

- [Buffering](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayBuffering) - `POST /SyncPlay/Buffering`  
  Notifies the group that your client is buffering. The group will wait for you to catch up. Use this when your
  connection is slow or you're experiencing playback issues.

- [Ready](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayReady) - `POST /SyncPlay/Ready`  
  Notifies the group that your client is ready to continue. Use this after buffering is complete or when you're ready to
  resume synchronized playback.

- [Set Ignore Wait](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlaySetIgnoreWait) - `POST /SyncPlay/SetIgnoreWait`  
  Tells the group whether to wait for you during buffering events. Set to true if you have a slow connection and don't
  want to hold up the group.

- [Ping](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayPing) - `POST /SyncPlay/Ping`  
  Updates your network latency information for better synchronization. The client should call this periodically to
  maintain accurate timing.

## WebSocket Messages

### Outbound Messages (Server â†’ Client)

#### SyncPlayCommand

### Inbound Messages (Client â†’ Server)

SyncPlay doesn't have dedicated inbound WebSocket message types. All client interactions go through the REST API
endpoints, which then trigger WebSocket notifications to synchronize all group members.

## SyncPlay Flow Diagram

The following diagram shows a typical SyncPlay session flow between two clients:

## Key Concepts

### Group States

- **Idle** - No media is playing
- **Waiting** - Waiting for all members to be ready
- **Paused** - Media is paused
- **Playing** - Media is actively playing

### Synchronization

- All playback commands (play, pause, seek) are synchronized across group members
- The server coordinates timing to ensure all clients stay in sync
- Buffering states are communicated to prevent desynchronization
- Network latency is compensated using ping measurements

### Access Control

- Users must have appropriate SyncPlay permissions
- Library access is enforced (users can only sync content they have access to)

### Ping Management

- **Frequency:** Clients should send ping updates every 60 seconds (1 minute)
- **Endpoint:** [POST /SyncPlay/Ping](https://api.jellyfin.org/#tag/SyncPlay/operation/SyncPlayPing)
- **Purpose:** Network latency measurement for precise synchronization timing

**Why Ping is Critical:**

- **Timing Coordination** - Commands like Unpause are scheduled with delays based on the highest ping in the group

**How to Measure Ping Time:**

Clients must calculate their own round-trip time to the Jellyfin server.

**Recommended Method:**

```javascript
async function measureAndSendPing() {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    await fetch('/System/Ping');

    const pingTime = Date.now() - startTime;

    await fetch('/SyncPlay/Ping', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'MediaBrowser Token="your-auth-token"',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({Ping: pingTime})
    });

    return pingTime;
}

// Call this function every 60 seconds while in a SyncPlay group
setInterval(measureAndSendPing, 60000);
```

**Implementation Requirements:**

- Send ping requests every 60 seconds while in a SyncPlay group
- Measure actual round-trip time before sending the ping update
- Use the measured ping time in the payload (not a placeholder)
- Continue pinging throughout the entire SyncPlay session
- Stop pinging when leaving the group

**Example Ping Payload:**

```json
{
  "Ping": 45
}
```

Where `Ping` is the measured round-trip time in milliseconds from your client to the Jellyfin server.
