[Jellyfin for Android](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-android) is an Android app that connects to Jellyfin instances and integrates with the [official web client](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web). It is compatible with most android devices including Android TV, Phones and Tablets.

## Features

- Android Native integration of the Web client
- Chromecast support (when installed from proprietary release flavor)
- Saved Credentials for multiple server/users

## Release Flavors

There are two flavors (variants) of the Jellyfin Android app:

- The proprietary version comes with Google Chromecast support
- The libre version comes without Google Chromecast support

The proprietary version is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jellyfin.mobile) and the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B081RFTTQ9), while the libre version is available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jellyfin.mobile/).

## Requirements

Since the Android app is just an Client for a Jellyfin server, all of these instructions assume that you already have a server up and running.
[Set it up now](../installation/index.mdx) if you haven't already.

- A Jellyfin server running version 10.10 or newer.
- Device running android.

You will be prompted to enter the Host URL to reach your jellyfin server. ex: [http://your_local_IP_address:8096](http://your_local_IP_address:8096 )

On newer android versions, you may observe a notification that requests to disable battery optimizations, selecting OK will bring you to the OS settings in order to Allow background usage.

You must then enter your login Credentials. Checking the Remember me box will have the credentials saved to get to you media faster.
You are now ready to enjoy your media.

## Multiple Jellyfin Servers support

> Jellyfin for android is an online only media player, downloaded content requires a different player on the device for playback

## Chromecast support

> make sure the server is reachable, the same URL should reach the server on a web browser. Note that this application does not make your server accessible outside your network, [see here](../post-install/networking/#external-access) for information about external access
