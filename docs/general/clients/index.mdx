:::info

### Requirements for Inclusion in All Clients

- Any client meeting the following requirements:
  - Must be aligned with the [Jellyfin Community Standards](/docs/general/community-standards).
    - In particular, the client must **NOT** engage in, encourage, or facilitate piracy.
    - The developer must be in good community standing in accordance to the Community Standards.
  - Must adhere to the [Jellyfin Branding Guidelines](/docs/general/contributing/branding) including usage of the Jellyfin name.
    - This includes the use of the Jellyfin name or `org.jellyfin` namespace that could hinder the ability to publish an official client to a store in the future.
  - Must include first rate support for Jellyfin servers. (I.e. Support for Jellyfin should be a primary function or at the same level of integration of any other supported services.)
  - Must **NOT** be specific to or intended to promote a specific hosted Jellyfin server instance.
  - Must have clear open-source licensing and be void of any known issues related to attribution, copyright, or license violations.

The final decision for inclusion is at the discretion of the Jellyfin Contributor Team following the decision-making guidelines in the [Jellyfin Constitution](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-meta/blob/master/policies-and-procedures/jellyfin-constitution.md).

### Requirements for Inclusion as a Recommended Client

- The client must be a first-party client (meaning published and maintained by the Jellyfin team with source freely licensed and available in the [Jellyfin GitHub organization](https://github.com/jellyfin)).

  **OR**

- The client must fill a significant void in the current first-party client offerings. Must be a high-quality client on a popular platform.

## Supported Browsers

Our goal is to provide support for the two most recent versions of these browsers.

- Firefox
- Firefox ESR
- Chrome
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for MacOS and iOS
- Edge

Older browsers may be supported as a result of the needs of specific web-based clients, but full functionality is not guaranteed on their desktop version.
