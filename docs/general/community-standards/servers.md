# Server Policy

Jellyfin is a free and open source project that provides the **tools to run your own server** for hosting your media, and clients to connect to one of those servers.

The Jellyfin Project itself, and members of the Jellyfin team, **do not provide servers for you to use**, with the sole exception of [our demo server for evaluation and testing](https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable).

**If you are using or paying someone for "Jellyfin" i.e. access to a specific server:**

* **It is not us. We do not run that server.** Do not contact us, privately or publicly, for help with connecting, resetting your password, etc. We cannot help you because we do not run the server. Contact whoever you are paying. If you do not know who that is, we cannot help you.

* **This is almost unequivocally piracy of some sort.** Do not discuss it with us [as per our community standards](/docs/general/community-standards).

Requests for support/help with other people's servers will be ignored.

## If You Run A Jellyfin Server

If you run a Jellyfin server instance for other people, ensure that your users are aware that **you** are their contact for help and support, not us. We are not your server's "customer support" team. **You are not "Jellyfin"**. Do not use our name. Do not insinuate to your users that your server is run by us or that we are the same people.

We will link your users to this page if they contact us for help with your server. If you are charging people for pirate access to a Jellyfin server and violate these guidelines, and we become aware, we reserve the right to report you to your hosting provider for piracy and ban you and your users from our support channels. This is [a violation of our community standards](/docs/general/community-standards) and will not be tolerated.

You have been warned.
