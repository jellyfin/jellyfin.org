# Server Policy

Jellyfin is a free and open source project that provides the **tools to run your own server** for hosting your media, and clients to connect to one of those servers.

The Jellyfin Project itself, and members of the Jellyfin team, **do not provide servers for you to use**, with the sole exception of [our demo server for evaluation and testing](https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable).

**If you are using or paying someone for "Jellyfin" i.e. access to a specific server:**

* **It is not us. We do not run that server.** Do not contact us, privately or publicly, for help with connecting, resetting your password, etc. We cannot help you because we do not run the server. Contact whoever you are paying. If you do not know who that is, we cannot help you.

* **This is almost unequivocably piracy of some sort.** Do not discuss it with us [as per our community standards guidelines](/docs/general/community-standards). **We are in no way affiliated with "Mobilvids" or any similar pirate services**.

Requests for support/help with other people's servers will be ignored.

## Running a Third Party Server

If you are running such a third party server, **you are not "Jellyfin"**. Do not use our name. Do not insinuate to your users that we are the same people. Do not send them to us for "support". We will link your users to this page if they contact us. If you insist on continuing, and we become aware, we reserve the right to report you to your hosting provider for piracy.
