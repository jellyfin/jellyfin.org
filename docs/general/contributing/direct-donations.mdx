Jellyfin is free and will always be free. We do not accept any money or benefit for any form of favor or feature and no implicit or explicit entitlement should be assumed or demanded when donating to jellyfin or one of its developers.

That said the many developers or moderators accept donations purely as a sign of gratitude for their volunteer work on the project or officially related.

This table is not conclusive and if you are missing a specific person you want to donate to, please contact the developer directly.
This list is also intentionally randomly ordered to avoid any appearance of favoring any one developer.

      .map((element) => (
