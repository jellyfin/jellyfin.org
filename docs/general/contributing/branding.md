# Branding

## Usage of the Jellyfin name

The name "Jellyfin" is reserved for the Jellyfin project itself and its official clients. The server (including WebUI) is called "Jellyfin", composed of the "Jellyfin [API] Server" and "Jellyfin Web[UI]". Official clients are, generally, called "Jellyfin for X", where "X" is a platform (e.g. "Jellyfin for Android TV").

3rd party developers should NOT use the name Jellyfin directly. Additionally, we **discourage** projects from using the combination of "Jelly[word]" or "[word]fin" to avoid confusion; while there are numerous exceptions over the years, we strongly request that you develop your own unique name for your project. You **may** reference Jellyfin in a subtitle, description, etc. as an indication of interoperability. For example, "Floostream, a Jellyfin client" is ideal.

Do NOT use the Jellyfin name in the promotion of piracy or to affiliate yourself erroneously with the project or impersonate the project. If you run a public server (which, by default, will use Jellyfin branding), please see [our server policy](/docs/general/community-standards/servers).

## Usage of the Jellyfin logo

Do NOT use the Jellyfin logo as your logo for any project, service, or group without the expressed permission of the Jellyfin team, i.e. the rounded-triangle-within-a-triangle shape. Do not simply rotate the logo shape, or include it inside of another logo; these count too. To help facilitate a common design language even among 3rd party clients, we **do permit** the use of our colour gradient on your logo; we simply request that you use a unique logo design/shape.

## Writing Style

As a general rule, Jellyfin should always be capitalized, but language, file, or system conventions trump Jellyfin naming conventions. 
Avoid "JellyFin".

Specific examples include:

- Writing referring to the project in the abstract should use capitalized `Jellyfin` at all times. `I contribute to Jellyfin and you should too!`
- Code elements should be formatted according to the specifications of the language in use.
- Git repositories and files using the name should use lowercase `jellyfin` for convenience on case-sensitive filesystems. `build-jellyfin.ps1`, `jellyfin_3.5.2-1_all.deb`, etc.
- Configuration directories can use either depending on operating system conventions. `/var/lib/jellyfin`, `AppData/Jellyfin`
