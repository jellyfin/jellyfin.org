# Branding

## Usage of the Jellyfin name

You are free to use the Jellyfin name to promote your project, with some restrictions:

- Do not use the Jellyfin name in a way that would make the average user think you are associated with the project, unless permission was given by the Project Leader or Leadership Team.
- Only include the Jellyfin name in your project's name in a way that makes it clear you are not affiliated with the Jellyfin project, and to indicate compatibility with Jellyfin (For example _Awesome Client for Jellyfin_).
- Do not use the Jellyfin name in any context that promotes, allows or encourages piracy.
- Do not wrongfully claim to be part of the Jellyfin team.

## Writing Style

As a general rule, Jellyfin should always be capitalized, but language, file, or system conventions trump Jellyfin naming conventions.

Specific examples include:

- Writing referring to the project in the abstract should use capitalized `Jellyfin` at all times. `I contribute to Jellyfin and you should too!`
- C# class and project names, including their files and directories, should use capitalized `Jellyfin` as required by the C# case standards (camelCase or PascalCase). `Jellyfin.LiveTv`, `Jellyfin.sln`
- Other code elements, where the code formatting or style requires lowercase, should use lowercase `jellyfin`. `jellyfinWebComponentsBowerPath`
- The Git repository and non-C# files inside of it should use lowercase `jellyfin` for convenience on case-sensitive filesystems. `build-jellyfin.ps1`
- The final output binary, initscrips, and package names should use lowercase `jellyfin` for similar reasons as above. `jellyfin.dll`, `jellyfin_3.5.2-1_all.deb`, `jellyfin.zip`
- Configuration directories can use either depending on operating system conventions. `/var/lib/jellyfin`, `AppData/Jellyfin`
- The logo has no strict rules for capitalization, the style is dependent on aesthetics and font choice.
