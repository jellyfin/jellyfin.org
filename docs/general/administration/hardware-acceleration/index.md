# Hardware Acceleration

The Jellyfin server can offload on the fly video transcoding by utilizing an integrated or discrete graphics card ([GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)) suitable to accelerate these workloads very efficiently without straining your CPU.

## Supported Acceleration Methods

The Jellyfin server uses a modified version of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) as its transcoder, namely [jellyfin-ffmpeg](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg). It enables the Jellyfin server to access the fixed-function video codecs, video processors and [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units) computing interfaces provided by the vendor of the installed GPU and the operating system.

The supported and validated video [hardware acceleration (HWA)](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro) methods are:

- **Intel** Quick Sync Video (QSV)

- **NVIDIA** NVDEC/NVENC (NVENC)

- **AMD** Advanced Media Framework (AMF)

- **Intel/AMD** Video Acceleration API (VA-API, Linux only)

- **Apple** Video Toolbox (macOS only)

- **Rockchip** RKMPP (Linux only)

## Full & Partial Acceleration

The transcoding pipeline usually has multiple stages, which can be simplified to:

- Video Decoding

- Video Deinterlacing (optional)

- Video Scaling & Format conversion (optional)

- Video HDR/DV Tone-mapping (optional)

- Video Subtitle burn-in (optional)

- Video Encoding

- Zero-copy in above stages

:::note

Some of these stages cannot be GPU accelerated due to software, hardware or driver limitations.

Partial acceleration may result in higher CPU usage and lower transcoding speed.

:::

Jellyfin supports full acceleration for:

- Mainstream Intel and Nvidia GPUs on Windows and Linux
- AMD Polaris and newer GPUs on Linux via VA-API and Vulkan interop
- Older AMD GPUs on Windows
- Rockchip VPU of RK3588/3588S
- Intel and Apple Silicon on macOS 12 and above

Using [jellyfin-ffmpeg](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg/releases) with Jellyfin is highly recommended, which has a `-Jellyfin` suffix in the version string.

```shell
$ /usr/lib/jellyfin-ffmpeg/ffmpeg

ffmpeg version 6.0.1-Jellyfin Copyright (c) 2000-2023 the FFmpeg developers
  built with gcc 12.2.0 (crosstool-NG 1.25.0.90_cf9beb1)
...
```

:::caution

Using FFmpeg binaries downloaded from somewhere else will result in partial acceleration.

Jellyfin-ffmpeg usually ships with our deb package, official Docker images and Windows installers.

The only exception is when using a portable installation or an unsupported distro, then it's required to manually download and set it in Jellyfin.

## Configure & Verify Hardware Acceleration

There are some preparations that need to be done before enabling hardware acceleration.

The specific configuration steps may vary between GPU vendors, installation methods, and operating systems.

On Linux you can check available GPU using the `lspci` command:

```shell
lspci -nn | grep -Ei "3d|display|vga"
```

Or using `lshw`:

```shell
lshw -C display
```

### AMD AMF & VA-API

Click [AMD GPU](/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/amd).

### NVIDIA NVENC

Click [NVIDIA GPU](/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/nvidia).

### Apple VideoToolbox

### Rockchip RKMPP

Click [Rockchip VPU](/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/rockchip).

## Enable Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration options can be found in the Admin Dashboard under the **Transcoding** section of the **Playback** tab.

Select a valid hardware acceleration method from the drop-down menu and a device if applicable.
Supported codecs need to be indicated by checking the boxes in **Enable hardware decoding for** and **Hardware encoding options**.

The hardware acceleration is available immediately for media playback. No server restart is required.

## Remote Hardware Acceleration

If your Jellyfin server does not support hardware acceleration, but you have another machine that does, you can leverage [rffmpeg](https://github.com/joshuaboniface/rffmpeg) to delegate the transcoding to another machine.

:::note

Currently Linux-only and requires SSH between the machines, as well as shared storage for media and the Jellyfin data directory.

:::

## Hardware Accelerated Tone-mapping

Jellyfin supports hardware accelerated tone-mapping of HDR10 and HLG to SDR.

Dolby Vision (P5 & P8) to SDR tone-mapping is supported in Jellyfin 10.8 and requires jellyfin-ffmpeg 5.0.1-5 or newer.

:::note

- Intel VPP HDR10 tone-mapping is supported on Intel QSV and VA-API on Linux.

- VPP is preferred if both tone-mapping options are enabled.

- Rockchip RKMPP currently only support HDR10 and HLG tone-mapping.

## Tips For Hardware Acceleration

- Avoid H.264 / AVC 10-bit videos

  :::tip

  The hardware decoding of H.264 / AVC 10-bit (High 10 profile) video is not supported by any Intel, NVIDIA and AMD GPU.
  It is only supported by Apple Silicon and Rockchip. Jellyfin will fallback to software decoding for it when there is
  no hardware decoder available. Consider upgrading such video to H.265 / HEVC 10-bit (Main 10 profile).

  :::

- iGPU / APU Prefer dual-channel memory

  :::tip

  Integrated GPUs take up a portion of system memory as their video memory, which means using dual-channel memory can double the video memory bandwidth. This can be useful while computing intensive workloads such as hardware HDR/DV tone-mapping.

  :::

- Use SSD or RamDisk for caching

  :::tip

  On modern GPUs, the peak throughput of video transcoding can be limited by the I/O speed of your hard drives. In this case, an SSD or RamDisk can be used for caching the transcoded temporary video segments.

  :::

- Tune encoder presets to trade off quality for speed

  :::tip

  Hardware encoder presets can greatly affect encoding speed. You can lower this preset in the Jellyfin dashboard to sacrifice encoding quality to maximize speed, or raise the preset to optimize encoding quality on an overkill GPU.

## Raspberry Pi Hardware Acceleration Support Deprecation

Jellyfin previously supported hardware acceleration on Raspberry Pi via `OpenMAX OMX` in Jellyfin 10.8, with partial support for Raspberry Pi via `V4L2` in 10.9. However, the support never reached the level of maturity seen with other acceleration methods. Many operations fell back to the already underperforming CPU, due to the lacking of full hardware acceleration. The situation worsened with the release of the latest generation of Raspberry Pi 5, which lacks hardware encoders entirely, rendering further development of hardware acceleration on this platform impractical.

As a result, we have to deprecate `V4L2` support for Raspberry Pi, unfortunately. While it may continue to work for now, future updates to the Linux kernel or FFmpeg could break this support, and it's unlikely that we'll address any resulting issues. This decision may be reversed if future Raspberry Pi models reintroduce hardware encoders.
