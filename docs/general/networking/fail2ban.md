## Fail2ban

[Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) is an intrusion prevention software framework that protects computer servers from brute-force attacks.
Fail2ban operates by monitoring log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/apache/access.log, etc.) for selected entries and running scripts based on their content.

Jellyfin produces logs that can be monitored by Fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks on your machine.

### Requirements

- Jellyfin remotely accessible
- Fail2ban installed and running
- Knowing where the logs for Jellyfin are stored: by default `/var/log/jellyfin/` for desktop and `/config/log/` for docker containers.

### Step one: create the jail

You need to create a jail for Fail2ban. If you're on Ubuntu and use nano as editor, run:

```bash
sudoedit /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/jellyfin.local
```

Add this to the new file, replacing `/path_to_logs` with the path to the log files above, e.g. `/var/log/jellyfin/`:

```bash
[jellyfin]

backend = auto
enabled = true
port = 80,443
protocol = tcp
filter = jellyfin
maxretry = 3
bantime = 86400
findtime = 43200
logpath = /path_to_logs/jellyfin*.log
```

Save and exit nano.

Note:

1. If Jellyfin is running in a docker container, add the following to the `jellyfin.local` file:

   ```bash
   action = iptables-allports[name=jellyfin, chain=DOCKER-USER]
   ```

2. If you're running Jellyfin on a non-standard port, then change the port from `80,443` to the relevant port say `8096,8920`

### Step two: create the filter

The filter contains a set of rules which Fail2ban will use to identify a failed authentication attempt. Create the filter by running:

```bash
sudoedit /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/jellyfin.conf
```

Paste:

```bash
[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Authentication request for .* has been denied \(IP: "<ADDR>"\)\.
```

Save and exit, then reload Fail2ban:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

Check fail2ban is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

### Step three: test

Assuming you've at least one failed authentication attempt, you can test this new jail with `fail2ban-regex`:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-regex /path_to_logs/*.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/jellyfin.conf --print-all-matched
```

## Advanced Fail2Ban Setup: Forwarding and Managing Bans on an Upstream Proxy Server

To enhance security, Fail2Ban can manage IP bans on an upstream reverse proxy server instead of directly on the Jellyfin server. This setup allows you to block malicious IPs closer to your network’s entry point, potentially benefiting other services using the same proxy.

This guide offers a configuration for setting up Fail2Ban to manage IP bans on an upstream reverse proxy server using **Dynamic Chains**, where each Fail2Ban jail creates and manages its own `iptables` chain on the upstream server.

### Assumptions

- **Fail2Ban** is installed on your local server (where Jellyfin is running).
- **iptables** is configured on the upstream server.

### Step one: Set Up SSH Key-Based Authentication

Ensure the Fail2Ban server can SSH into the upstream server without needing a password. This is crucial for automating the IP ban/unban process.

Replace `<upstream-server-ip>` with the actual IP address of your upstream server.

1. **Generate SSH Key (if not already done):**

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Copy the SSH Key to the Upstream Server:**

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@<upstream-server-ip>
   ```

3. **Test SSH Access:**

   Ensure the SSH connection works without needing a password:

   ```bash
   ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa root@<upstream-server-ip>
   ```

### Step two: Configure Fail2Ban for Dynamic Chains

1. **Create the Fail2Ban Action File**:

   On the Fail2Ban server, create a new action file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/proxy-iptables-dynamic.conf
   ```

   And add the Following Configuration, which will dynamically create, manage, and remove `iptables` chains on the upstream server per jail:

   Remember to replace `<upstream-server-ip>` with the actual IP address of your upstream server.

   ```ini
   [Definition]

   # Option: actionban
   # 1. Create the chain if it doesn't exist
   # 2. Add the banned IP to the dynamic chain based on the jail name
   # 3. Log the event
   actionban = ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null root@<upstream-server-ip> \
                   'iptables -N f2b-<name> 2>/dev/null || true; \
                    iptables -C INPUT -j f2b-<name> 2>/dev/null || iptables -I INPUT -j f2b-<name>; \
                    iptables -I f2b-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j DROP' && \
                    echo "Banned <ip> from jail <name> via upstream proxy" >> /var/log/fail2ban.log
   
   # Option: actionunban
   # 1. Remove the banned IP from the dynamic chain
   # 2. Remove the chain if it becomes empty (cleanup)
   # 3. Log the event
   actionunban = ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null root@<upstream-server-ip> \
                   'iptables -D f2b-<name> -s <ip> -j DROP; \
                    if ! iptables -L f2b-<name> | grep -q "DROP"; then \
                        iptables -D INPUT -j f2b-<name>; \
                        iptables -F f2b-<name>; \
                        iptables -X f2b-<name>; \
                    fi' && \
                    echo "Unbanned <ip> from jail <name> via upstream proxy and cleaned up chain if empty" >> /var/log/fail2ban.log
   ```

   After making chaneges, save and close the file.

2. **Update Fail2Ban Jails to Use the Dynamic Chain Action**:

   Open your jail configuration file, usually located at `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   ```

   And for each jail you want to manage via the upstream proxy, add or modify the action line to use the proxy-iptables-dynamic action. Here’s an example configuration for two jails:

   ```ini
   [jellyfin]
   enabled  = true
   filter   = jellyfin
   logpath  = /path/to/jellyfin/log
   maxretry = 3
   bantime  = 3600
   action   = proxy-iptables-dynamic

   [nginx-http-auth]
   enabled  = true
   filter   = nginx-http-auth
   logpath  = /var/log/nginx/error.log
   maxretry = 5
   bantime  = 3600
   action   = proxy-iptables-dynamic
   ```

   After making chaneges, save and close the file.

### Step three: Restart Fail2Ban and Test the Setup

1. **Restart Fail2Ban**:

   After making the configuration changes, restart Fail2Ban to apply the new settings:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
   ```

2. **Check Jail Status**:

   Verify the status of your jails to ensure they are running correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client status jellyfin
   ```

3. **Test a Ban**:

   Trigger a ban by performing invalid login attempts or by manually banning an IP. For example:

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client set jellyfin banip 192.168.1.100
   ```

4. **Verify on Upstream Server**:

   Check if the IP is banned in the corresponding jail's chain on the upstream server ('f2b-jail-name'):

   ```bash
   ssh root@<upstream-server-ip> "iptables -L f2b-jellyfin"
   ```

5. **Test Unbanning**:

   To test unbanning, manually unban the IP:

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client set jellyfin unbanip 192.168.1.100
   ```

6. **Verify Unban**:

    Verify that the IP is removed from the corresponding jail's chain ('f2b-jail-name'):

   ```bash
   ssh root@<upstream-server-ip> "iptables -L f2b-jellyfin"
   ```

### Step four: Monitor Logs

Monitor the Fail2Ban log to ensure that actions are being executed properly:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
```

This log will display messages whenever an IP is banned or unbanned, helping you confirm that the configuration is working as expected.
