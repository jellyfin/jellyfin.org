# Local .nfo metadata

Jellyfin can read and write local .nfo metadata files to import or export metadata from and to other programs and tools.

## Naming .nfo files

In order for Jellyfin to find the .nfo files, you have to name them correctly. The table below will help you name them.

| Media Type   | Filename                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Movies       | `movie.nfo`, `VIDEO_TS.nfo` or for DVDs `<filename of the movie>.nfo` |
| TV Shows     | `tvshow.nfo`                                                          |
| TV Season    | `season.nfo`                                                          |
| Episode      | `<filename of the episode>.nfo`                                       |
| Music Artist | `artist.nfo`                                                          |
| Music Album  | `album.nfo`                                                           |
| Music Video  | see Movies                                                            |

## Reading metadata from .nfo files

Jellyfin supports a common set of .nfo metadata tags. The following list may not be exhaustive.

:::caution
If there are multiple tags that map to the same internal Jellyfin data like `plot` and `review`, the last of these tags in the file will have priority.
:::

:::note
It's currently not possible to disable .nfo metadata. Local metadata will always be fetched and has priority over remote metadata providers like TMDb.
:::

:::note
User data importing is only possible for a single user. This user can be set in the .nfo settings.

Provider id tags are supported as well if they follow the scheme: `<PROVIDER_NAME`+ `id>`.

You can also use your .nfo files to help Jellyfin identify your media. You can just enter an IMDb, TMDb or TVDb link, to link the media to the specific provider id.

For more information about .nfo files, please also see the [Kodi wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files).

## Writing metadata to .nfo files

Jellyfin can write metadata to .nfo files. To enable this option, select the "Nfo saver" in the settings of your library. While writing .nfo files, the following tags are supported for saving:

Additional provider ids are supported as well. They will be exported with the tag `<providernameid>`.

## Image paths and URLs in .nfo files

There are some small caveats to keep in mind when using .nfo files for your images.

- Jellyfin supports only one image for each artwork type. This means that only the first `thumb` tag for each artwork type is used.
- Artwork defined in .nfo files with local paths or URLs have priority over remote image providers and images in the media folders.
