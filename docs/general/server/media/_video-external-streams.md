## External Subtitles and Audio Tracks

External Subtitles and audio tracks can be added with file suffixes.

```txt
/Movies
    /Film (1986)
        Film.mkv
        Film.default.srt
        Film.default.en.forced.ass
        Film.forced.en.dts
        Film.en.sdh.srt
        Film.English Commentary.en.mp3
```

```txt

    /Show (2021)
        /Season 1
            Show (2021) S01E01 Title.avi
            Show (2021) S01E01 Title.ja.ass
            Show (2021) S01E01 Title.commentary.ja.aac
```

Each title/flag field can be a generic string, or a special flag. A file can have multiple flags, separated with `.`

| Type             | Flag                |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Default          | `default`           |
| Forced           | `forced`, `foreign` |
| Hearing Impaired | `sdh`, `cc`, `hi`   |

`hi` collides with the Hindi language abbreviation. `hi` by itself will resolve as a Hindi language track, while `hi` in addition to another language identifier (such as `title.en.hi.srt`) will use the other language and tag it as hearing impaired.

Flags are ignored on containers with more than one stream.

Any arbitrary text not parsable to a language or flag will be combined and used as the title of the stream (if there is not a stream title already embedded in the file metadata). The last file in the above example will be parsed as an English mp3 audio stream with the title `English Commentary`.
