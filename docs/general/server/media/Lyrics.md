[length: 03:29]
[00:08.38]Are you (are you)
[00:10.44]Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to)
[00:14.31]Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to)
[00:18.25]It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
[00:22.69]
[00:23.94]Play fair (play fair)
[00:26.06]Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature)
[00:29.94]Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there)
[00:33.75]And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)
[00:38.82]

```Unsynchronized
Are you (are you)
Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to)
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to)
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night

Play fair (play fair)
Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature)
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there)
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)

But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
