### Theme media

Theme media gives browsing your library a more audio-visual touch by playing theme songs and/or Theme videos in the background while you're looking at your media listings.

:::tip

For these to play, users need to enable the option in their clients. In the WebUI and WebUI-based clients this is found in the User settings under Display > Libraries > Theme songs, and Theme videos, respectively. Implementations in third-party clients may differ.

:::

In case both Theme songs and Theme videos are found and enabled, Theme videos will be preferred and Theme songs will not play.

In the WebUI and WebUI-based clients, if there are multiple Theme media found, they will be shuffled when opening the listing. This cannot be changed.

#### Songs

- theme.ext
- theme-music/\*

#### Videos

- backdrops/\*

:::tip

Just like any other media, Theme media will be transcoded when required or requested by the client. However, since transcoding can result in delay of Theme media playback, Web-standard formats like WebM (VP9/Opus) are recommended for a smooth experience, as they generally direct play.
