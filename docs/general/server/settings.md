# Settings

The general settings include options that don't require their own link in the sidebar. Most of these are items that will change the interface or user experience.

## Server Name

This name will be displayed to users when they select a server, and clients might use it in other locations as well. The default value will be the hostname of the computer.

## Login Disclaimer

This message will be shown to users when they login to your server.

## Custom Style

You can add custom CSS rules for minor changes to the web interface that don't require their own theme.
