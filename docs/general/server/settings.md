# Settings

The general settings include options that don't require their own link in the sidebar. Most of these are items that will change the interface or user experience.

## Server Name

This name will be displayed to users when they select a server, and clients might use it in other locations as well. The default value will be the hostname of the computer.

## Splash Screen Image

The plash screen image is used by some clients as a background for login screens or similar.
The default image is generated from images of the content on your server and is visible without authenticating and therefore can expose what content may be present on your server.
Only content with a rating equivalent to PG-13 or lower is used for generating the image, but this depends on the content having accurate rating data.

## Login Disclaimer

This message will be shown to users when they login on your server.

## Custom Style

You can add custom CSS rules for minor changes to the web interface that don't require their own theme.
