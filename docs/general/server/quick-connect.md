# Quick Connect

**Quick Connect** is a feature that allows users to sign in to clients **without entering a username or password**. Instead, a temporary **Quick Connect code** is generated and used to authorize login from an already authenticated client.

This feature streamlines the sign-in process, especially on devices with limited input options (like TVs or set-top boxes).

## Disabling Quick Connect (Server)

By default, Quick Connect is enabled.
To disable it, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** on your Jellyfin server.  

    `Settings` > `Dashboard`
2. Navigate to the **General** Tab
3. Uncheck the box:  
   ✅ **Enable Quick Connect on this server**

## Supported Clients

Quick Connect functionality is supported in two contexts:

## Using Quick Connect

The Quick Connect process involves two devices:

- **Device A**: A new client where you want to log in.
- **Device B**: An already authenticated client (such as your browser, phone, etc.).

### On Device A (New Device - the one you want to log into)

1. Open the Jellyfin client and choose **Quick Connect** (usually found on the login screen).
    On some clients, you will first need to press **Manual Login**; others may display the quick-connect code directly.
2. A **6-character code** will be displayed. Keep this screen open.

### On Device B (Already Logged-In Device)

1. Open Jellyfin and go to:  
   `Settings` > `Quick Connect`
2. Enter the 6-character code from Device A and confirm.
3. If successful, Device A will be logged in automatically—no need to enter a username or password.
