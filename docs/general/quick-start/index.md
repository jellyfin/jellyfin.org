# Quick Start

1. Install Jellyfin on [your system](/docs/general/installation) with the installation method for your platform.

1. Edit the [web configuration](/docs/general/clients/web-config) and adjust the options to fit your desired privacy level.

   - Our defaults sacrifice some absolute self-hosting for often requested features.
   - If this is concerning, please review the documentation and edit accordingly.

1. Browse to `http://SERVER_IP:8096` to access the included web client.

1. Follow the initial setup wizard.

   - Libraries and users can always be added later from the dashboard.
   - Remember the username and password so you can login after the setup.

1. Secure the server with a method of your choice.

   - Create an SSL certificate and add it to the **Networking** page.
   - Put your server behind a [reverse proxy](/docs/general/networking/index.md#running-jellyfin-behind-a-reverse-proxy).
   - Only allow local connections and refrain from forwarding any ports.

1. Enjoy your media!
